Product of Non-zero Inputs 

Scenario: Read integers until -1 is entered (terminator). Compute the product of all non-zero inputs (ignore zeros). If 
there are no non-zero inputs, output 0. 

Input: Sequence of integers, each on its own line, terminated by -1. -1 is not included in the product. 
Output: Single integer: product or 0 if no non-zero numbers.
